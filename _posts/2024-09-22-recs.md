It appears to me that the literature about recommenders and personalization is essentially split into these categories:
 1. More theoretical results: typically proofs of convergence of some method and then tested on some benchmark dataset
 2. Real-world tests with existing or new methods: company X implements method Y and shows how much that improves target metrics compared to some basiline. Occasionally, the company will also show some new metrics or proxy metrics (see for example are the corpus-related metrics presented by DeepMind and experimented on YouTube Shorts [here](https://arxiv.org/html/2305.07764v2))
 3. Engineering-related aspects of recommenders: data engineering and practical machine learning engineering consideration to run recommenders more in real-time at scale (a good example is the [TikTok recommender paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07663))
 4. A mix of the above

Assuming you are a data scientist or ML engineer, I believe one should be interested in all of them, with probably a focus on 2,3 and 4.
