When it comes to experimentation and A/B testing, it seems that a lot of people focus on methods for calculating  statistical significance (are you using p-values or a Bayesian approach, etc.). However, you will quickly realize that it is probably a fairly small part of your entire experimentation platform and culture.

A book that has helped me tremendously in my efforts towards improving experimentation is [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments/D97B26382EB0EB2DC2019A7A7B518F59#fndtn-metrics)

And here is the list of my favourite resources on methods for calculating statistical significance:
 - [Calculating p-values](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-b-testing-simple-explanation-of-maths-behind-a3b2f059e619)
